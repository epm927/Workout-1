1) File Structure
-----------------

Following the commands outlined in the assignment I created the necessary folders: (I know the document says not to use `eval = FALSE` but in order to display the commands I used in terminal I have to)

``` r
cd stat133-hws-fall18
mkdir workout1
cd workout1
touch README.md
mkdir data
mkdir code
mkdir output
mkdir report
```

After a series of commands in the terminal (initializing, configuring, etc.), I have pushed the necessary files into my [repository](https://github.com/epm927/Workout-1.git).

### Downloading the Data:

Using the `curl -O` command (in the terminal, inside the `data/` folder), I downloaded the data.

2) Create a **`README`** file
