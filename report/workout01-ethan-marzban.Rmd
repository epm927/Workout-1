```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1) File Structure

Following the commands outlined in the assignment I created the necessary folders: (I know the document says not to use `eval = FALSE` but in order to display the commands I used in terminal I have to)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
cd stat133-hws-fall18
mkdir workout1
cd workout1
touch README.md
mkdir data
mkdir code
mkdir output
mkdir report
```
